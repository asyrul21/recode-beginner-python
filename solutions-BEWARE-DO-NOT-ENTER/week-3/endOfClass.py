# 2. Find the squared value of that number by multiplying the variable by itself.
# 3. Store the result in a new variable called `result`
# 4. Use the print() syntax to output the result to screen
myNumber = 5
result = myNumber * myNumber
print("The square of " + str(myNumber) + " is " + str(result))


# calculate the area of a rectangle and print to screen
# 1. Define a variable named `width`, and assign it the value of 15

# 4. Store the result in a variable named `result`
# 5. Use print() to output the result
width = 15
height = 12

result = width * height
