# The first part is to output multiples of 3 between 0 - 20
# we use the range() method to generate numbers from 1 - 20
# it is crucial to note that range() returns an array/list
# recall the use of the % operator - to check the remainder of a division
# thus, if a number is divided by 3 and has remainder 0, the number is considered
# to be a multiple of 3

print("The Multiples of 3:")
for number in range(1, 20):
    # perform your logic here

# The second part is to output odd numbers between 0 - 20
# like above, we use the range() method to generate numbers between 1 - 20
# to output odd numbers, we take that if a number is divided by 2 and has remainder of non 0
# then then number is odd.

print()
print("Odd Numbers:")
# write your loop here
