# The palindrome Checker
# 1. create a varible named word and assign it to the input() statement you learned last week
# 2. Transform this word to all lowercase by performing word.lower()
# 3. Set a flag named Palindrom and set it to True
# 4. Setup a for loop with enumeration, and check that the current letter must
# be equals to the letter at the same position from the bacl
# 5. If this is not true, you may change Palindrom to False, and break from the loop
# 6. Finally, if Palindrome is True, output something like "This is a palindrome!". Else, output a different message.


print("Welcome to the Palindrome Checker")
print()

word1 = input("Insert a word: ")
word1 = word1.lower()

# your logic here
palindrome = True
