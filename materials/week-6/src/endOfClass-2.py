# The second part of the end of class exercise is to write a function which concatenates
# string variables.
# We first ask the user for his first name.
# Then we ask the user for his last name.
# These two variables will be passed into a function which will concatenate these names.
# Finally, we output to screen the full name

# define your function here
# def ...

firstName = input("Your first name: ")
lastName = input("Your last name: ")

# output = ...call your method here...
# print("Your full name is: " + output)
