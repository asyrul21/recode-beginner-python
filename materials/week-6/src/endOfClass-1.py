# The first part of this exercise is to define a function which returns a boolean.
# it returns True if the number is odd, otherwise return False
# If you remember, we assume that if a number is divided by 2 has a remainder of non 0, the
# number is an odd number.
# The loop will iterate through a list of numbers, and will call your function to check
# if each of the number is odd


print("Printing odd numbers")
# define your function here
# def ...

numbers = range(0, 20)
for number in numbers:
    if( ... call your function here ...):
        print(str(number) + " is an odd number")
