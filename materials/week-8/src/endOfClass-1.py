# The first part of the End of Class exercise is to learn how
# to import external and local libraries.
# 1. From the folder helper, there's a file named JsonReadWriter.py
#   from that folder, import the class JsonReadWriter
# 2. Do a `conda list`. See if you already have a library called pprint installed.
#   If you don't, install it by doing `conda install pprint`
# 3. Instantiate the JsonReadWriter class by passing in the path
#   to the data file. The data is in `data/json/students.json`
# 4. Load the Json data and store in a variable, using the JsonReadWriter's `load()`
#   method. Print the result if necessary.
# 5. Instantiate the pprint class by calling `pprint.PrettyPrinter(indent=4)`
# 6. Now, use the pprint instance you created to display the data nicely to screen, by
#   calling its `pprint(data)` instance method.
# 7. Display the third student's names, class, and mobile number to the screen nicely.
