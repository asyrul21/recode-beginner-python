# For this week's end of class, given the data files, you need to perform
# simple data analytics using Pandas to answer a few  Analysis questions:
# 1. What is the average height of all the students joining from Malaysia?
# 2. list down the names of students, together with their parents'. To do this, you may
#   need to join your students data frame with the "parents.csv" data frame. Use the Github #   notes to help you!
# 3. Finally, you need to deliver gifts to all your students scoring an A, but only for
#   those living in Malaysia.
#   List down the names, their marks, their addresses, their parents' names, and
#   their contact numbers of these students, to help you with the shipping work. Also,
#   don't forget to save this resulting data back as a CSV! Name this file as result.csv
#   TIP: You may need to perform more than one Joins!
