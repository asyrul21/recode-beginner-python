# The Calculate Area of either Rectangle or Triangle
# 1. Ask user whether to calculate area of Rectangle or Triangle. To proceed with Rectangle, user needs to
#   input "r". To proceed with Triangle, user needs to input "t". etc. Note that these are case sensitive
#   For any other input, tell the user that the input is invalid.
# 2. Based on user choice, ask more information to allow you to perform the calculation.
#   For example, to calculate area of rectangle, you need to ask for width and length.
#   To calculate area of circle, you need ask for the radius.
# 3. Do not forget to cast the user input to float before performing calculation
# 4. Perform the calculation accordingly and output to the user.
