# Recode Beginner Python Masterclass

Welcome to Recode's Beginner Python Masterclass!

This is the official repository of the course, which contains all the materials you need throughout the course.

To clone this repository to your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have Git installed and set up.

2. Create a folder in your local machine anywhere you would like the course material to be. I suggest in Documents, create a folder called Programming, where you can store all your programming stuff. Then, within the Programming folder, create another folder called Python where you will store all python-related files/folders.

   _SOME TIPS WHEN CREATING A FILE OR A FOLDER_

   1. avoid names with spaces. use dashes "-" or camel case to connect various words. Example:

   - dash : my-folder-name
   - camel case : myFolderName

   2. Avoid using Symbols or [unicode characters](https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/category/So) in your file/folders names.

   3. Plain english would do it.

3. On your terminal, navigate to the created folder. Use `ls -l` and `cd` to traverse through your file system. On Windows, use `dir` and `cd`

4. Once you have reached your desired folder, simply run:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

5. Every week, new content will be removed/added according to tutor's or students' needs. To ammend those changes locally into your machines, before each class, run `git pull` as well.

6. Happy Coding!
